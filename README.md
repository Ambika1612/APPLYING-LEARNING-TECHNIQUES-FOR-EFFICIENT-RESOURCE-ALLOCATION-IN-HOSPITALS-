# APPLYING-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES-FOR-EFFICIENT-RESOURCE-ALLOCATION-IN-HOSPITALS-
The Resource Allocation system helps is allocating beds for patients in particular wards based on their  reports and also allocates shifts and wards to staffs of hospital. The efficient allocations can be carried  based on dividing the resources into three modules such as ward/bed allocation, staff allocation and  patient module. Ward module will contain the details regarding number of beds available and occupied.  Staff module will contain the details of to which ward they are allocated to and shifts in which they are  working. The patient module contain the details like reason for admitting to hospital, number for days  to be admitted. To handle this allocation problem a system can be developed using Machine learning  algorithms and python programming language.
